        <h>Introduction</h>
        <p>
            Registering for classes is a total pain. Not only is it difficult to schedule the classes around each other, you have to figure out which classes you need for your major and graduation. 
            A few tools already exist (graduation reqs. on my.pugetsound, coursicle), but each only does a handful of the various things necessary to plan your schedule. 
            It would be much more convenient and usable in one integrated piece of software that could allow you to plan your schedule with knowledge of the classes and not overlap them. 
            We want to build a software environment where students, department heads, and administrators can securely log in and access slightly different sites. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The students have a homepage where they can reach several different features. It will include a  feature to search classes that will recommend certain classes based on major and year as well as general graduation requirements. 
            Other than that the student should be able to access a weekly schedule view that will visibly show if there are overlap times or if they're non major classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The registrar and department heads will have a slightly different view of the site where they can create classes in different departments and add them to the graduation requirements. Students can't do either of those things and registrar/department heads shouldn't be able to plan a schedule.
        </p>
        
        <h>Proposed Features</h>
            <ol>
                <li>Students and administrators can login in securely using encrypted credentials 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students can't access other students' pages</li>
                        <li>Students can't access the database</li>
                        <li>Only department heads and registrar can add or delete classes</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The department head and registrar facing part of the site is different and allows them to add/remove classes that are offered that year and determine what the required prerequisites are and if it is required for graduation or a major</li>
                
                <li>On student login it has a dashboard that allows them to select between different options
                    <ul>
